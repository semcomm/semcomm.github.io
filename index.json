propose a novel neural waveform compression method to catalyze emerging speech semantic communications. By introducing nonlinear transform and variational modeling, we effectively capture the dependencies within speech frames and estimate the probabilistic distribution of the speech feature more accurately, giving rise to better compression performance. In particular, the speech signals are analyzed and synthesized by a pair of nonlinear transforms, yielding latent features. An entropy model with hyperprior is built to capture the probabilistic distribution of latent features, followed with quantization and entropy coding. The proposed waveform codec can be optimized flexibly towards arbitrary rate, and the other appealing feature is that it can be easily optimized for any differentiable loss function, including perceptual loss used in semantic communications. To further improve the fidelity, we incorporate residual coding to mitigate the degradation arising from quantization distortion at the latent space. Results indicate that achieving the same performance, the proposed method saves up to 27% coding rates than widely used adaptive multi-rate wideband (AMR-WB) codec as well as emerging neural waveform coding methods.","tags":["Speech","semantic"],"title":"Variational Speech Waveform Compression to Catalyze Semantic Communications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jincheng Dai","Sixian Wang","Ke Yang","Kailin Tan","XiaoqiQin","Zhongwei Si","Kai Niu","PingZhang"],"categories":["semantic comm"],"content":"","date":1667291044,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667291044,"objectID":"d9a39b240ad0f07e438718c37de7519e","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/publication/adaptive-semantic-communications-overfitting-the-source-and-channel-for-profit/","publishdate":"2022-11-01T16:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/adaptive-semantic-communications-overfitting-the-source-and-channel-for-profit/","section":"publication","summary":"Most semantic communication systems leverage deep learning models to provide end-to-end transmission performance surpassing the established source and channel coding approaches. While, so far, research has mainly focused on architecture and model improvements, but such a model trained over a full dataset and ergodic channel responses is unlikely to be optimal for every test instance. Due to limitations on the model capacity and imperfect optimization and generalization, such learned models will be suboptimal especially when the testing data distribution or channel response is different from that in the training phase, as is likely to be the case in practice. To tackle this, in this paper, we propose a novel semantic communication paradigm by leveraging the deep learning model's overfitting property. Our model can for instance be updated after deployment, which can further lead to substantial gains in terms of the transmission rate-distortion (RD) performance. This new system is named adaptive semantic communication (ASC). In our ASC system, the ingredients of wireless transmitted stream include both the semantic representations of source data and the adapted decoder model parameters. Specifically, we take the overfitting concept to the extreme, proposing a series of ingenious methods to adapt the semantic codec or representations to an individual data or channel state instance. The whole ASC system design is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the loss function that is a tripartite tradeoff among the data rate, model rate, and distortion terms. The experiments (including user study) verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our ASC system. Notably, the substantial gain of our overfitted coding paradigm can catalyze semantic communication upgrading to a new era.","tags":[],"title":"Adaptive Semantic Communications: Overfitting the Source and Channel for Profit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jun Wang","Sixian Wang","Jincheng Dai","Zhongwei Si","DekunZhou","Kai Niu"],"categories":["semantic comm"],"content":"","date":1667291044,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667291044,"objectID":"76dae2101af3e4a2e6d7043faf507ce9","permalink":"https://thuiar.github.io/publication/perceptual-learned-source-channel-coding-for-high-fidelity-image-semantic-transmission/","publishdate":"2022-11-01T16:24:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/perceptual-learned-source-channel-coding-for-high-fidelity-image-semantic-transmission/","section":"publication","summary":"As one novel approach to realize end-to-end wireless image semantic transmission, deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (deep JSCC) method is emerging in both deep learning and communication communities.

But for low transmission rates, due to the imperfect wireless channel, these distortion metrics lose significance as they favor pixel-wise preservation. To account for human visual perception in semantic communications, it is of great importance to develop new deep JSCC systems optimized beyond traditional PSNR and MS-SSIM metrics. In this paper, we introduce adversarial losses to optimize deep JSCC, which tends to preserve global semantic information and local texture. Our new deep JSCC architecture combines encoder, wireless channel, decoder/generator, and discriminator, which are jointly learned under both perceptual and adversarial losses. Our method yields human visually much more pleasing results than state-of-the-art engineered image coded transmission systems and traditional deep JSCC systems.

Also, channel coded transmission does not identify the source content. In this sense, state-of-the-art communication systems work merely at the technical level, as summarized by Weaver. Unlike the traditional system design philosophy, this article proposes a new route to boost the system capabilities toward intelligence-endogenous and primitive-concise communications. The communication paradigm upgrades to the semantic level, which is radically different since all the key techniques imply the use of meanings of transmitted data, thus deeply changing the design philosophy of the communication system. This paradigm shift unveils a promising direction due to its ability to offer an identical quality of service with much lower data transmission requirements.

Since all procedures are considered over wireless links, the quality of training is affected by wireless factors such as packet errors. In the considered model, compressed data given by the neural source encoder (NSE) are fed into an error-control channel encoder and modulated as discrete symbols sent over a memoryless channel. In the receiving end, the channel decoder and the neural source decoder (NSD) forms an iterative structure to reconstruct the original image. Since all neural compressed data are transmitted over wireless channels, the training of NSD is affected by wireless channel factors such as residual bit errors given by the channel decoder. Meanwhile, during outer-loop iterations, the NSD needs to match the variant of information reliability output by the channel decoder so as to build a global optimal receiver. To this end, a refiner neural network is first attached after the NSD to adjust its output as the format of a priori information sent into the channel decoder. Then, the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) functions of channel decoder and NSD are derived. At each iteration, the reliability of messages sent into the NSD is explicitly predicted by using the EXIT chart. By this means, the NSD can be trained in a residual bit error aware manner, and we realize a joint learning and iterative decoding framework to ensure the quality of neural image transmission over realistic wireless channels.

The underlying channels on each polar subcode have uniform reliability by dividing different blocks according to the reliabilities of the underlying channel. Based on this characteristic of BP scheme, we propose a rate-allocation (RA) method to study fast code construction of BP scheme. The key idea of the proposed RA method is finding out the equivalent channel whose average symmetric capacity equals the target transmission rate. The allocated rates are computed according to the symmetric capacities of split channels under the block polarization between polar subcodes. Then the ranking of bit indices within each polar subcode can be obtained by fixed sequence. In this way, the RA code construction is concise and robust for diverse configurations which are the desired features for practical implementation. Simulation results show that the proposed BP scheme under RA construction can achieve almost identical performance as the Gaussian approximation construction with much lower complexity.","tags":[],"title":"Block Polarization HARQ for Polar-Coded Modulation","type":"publication"}]
